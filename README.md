## Description

The whole purpose of this project is, as a new developper, to expand my knowledge and skills on development, front and back.

Front-end will be done with Angular for a Typescript full-stack.

Features previsions:
- Full CRUD of users with TypeORM
- Security with JWT
- Good code practices, commented code,...
- Use of Swagger for the API
- Already builted requests example via the postman collection shared on this repo
- Use of environment variables and a dedicated service
- Using the full possibilities that are implemented in NestJS : custom decorators, pipes (for DTO to Entities for example), interceptors, guards(for security and administration),...

Long term features:
- Possibility for users to add other uthers to their "friend list", they will have the possibility to share an expense balance page shared to track who must paid the coffee to whom next time. (Yes this is a tricount)
